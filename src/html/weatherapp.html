      I went into this project with a nerdy urge to create something involving precipitation radar data. I mean who doesn’t like to visit <a href="https://regnradar.se/">regnradar.se</a> 
      when they see a rain cloud to better understand how much rain they’re looking at? Nerdy urges aside, the offical reason for creating the weather app was that my household wanted a place to easily spot time and temperature in the home. That is of course why the two white windows with current temprature and time takes up a good amount of space in the UI; they´re easily visible from different angles and distances even when shown on a small display. The graph serves as a serious decision making tool when dressing my young one for the kindergarden and the map with precipitation radar data is just a delight to look at. Visit <a href="https://github.com/odsmal/weather-app">the GitHub repo</a> to see what the weather app is made of.

    <h3>To do</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Color mismatch</b></br>When overlapping the wind and temprature colors look horrendous - fix!</li>
        <li><b>More radar images</b></br>Make it possible to select radar images from different time episodes. The app is currently only displaying the latest image fetched from SMHI.</li>
        <li><b>Radar image color scale</b></br>Add a color scale to make sense of the radar data coloring.</li>
        <li><b>Responsive design</b></br>Maybe make the app responsive. It is currently hardcoded for a 1280x720 display.</li>
      </ul>
