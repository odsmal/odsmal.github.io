    So the actual background for creating this weather app, besides my nerdy urge to create something involving precipitation radar data, 
    is that my household wanted a place to easily spot time and temperature while at home. That is of course why the two white windows with current temprature and time takes up a good amount of space in the UI. The graph serves as a serious decision making tool when dressing my young one for the kindergarden and the map with precipitation radar data is just a delight to look at. Visit <a href="https://github.com/odsmal/weather-app">the GitHub repo</a> to see what the weather app is made of.

    <h3>To do</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>When overlapping the wind and temprature graphics look horrendous - fix!</li>
        <li>Make it possible to select radar images from different time episodes. The app is currently only displaying the latest image fetched from SMHI.</li>
        <li>Add a color scale to make sense of the radar data coloring.</li>
        <li>Maybe make the app responsive. It is currently hardcoded for a 1280x720 display.</li>
      </ul>
