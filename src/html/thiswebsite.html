      My aim is to keep this website very simple and then use it to publish stuff related to all wonderful projects in my pipeline. Let's see how it goes.

    <h3>To do âœ“</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Responsive design</b></br>I'm not aiming for full compatibility with Netscape v1.0 on a pager, but one should be able to visit this website on a modern phone without any issues</li>
        <li><b>Project navigation drop-down</b></br>The navigation link at the top of the pages named "PROJECTS" needs a dropdown that shows all published projects</li>
        <li><b>Previous page functionality</b></br>So apparently doing the page with javascript has created some unplanned issues, like this one</li>
      </ul>
