      <h3>Dedicated</h3>

        to result in a product that is well thought out and fit for its purpose.

      <h3>User centered</h3>
      <p>
        I keep the users invovled no matter where I am in the process of
        building their tool. I design for them and for what they want to
        accomplish.
