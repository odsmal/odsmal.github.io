      <p>
        My name is Kristoffer and I make digital user interfaces for physical
        products. My design solutions reside in products ranging from fighter
        jets to production line equipment.

      <h3>Forward leaning</h3>
      <p>
        I take charge of the thing I'm designing, I care about it and I want it
        to result in a product that is well thought out and fit for its purpose.

      <h3>User centric</h3>
      <p>
        I keep the users invovled no matter where I am in the process of
        building their tool. I design for them and for what they want to
        accomplish.

      <h3>Persistent</h3>
      <p>
        A design processes is an adventure with ups and downs. It won't always
        be a walk in the park. But one should always keep walking.
